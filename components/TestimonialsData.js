      review: "My experience with GreenView Solutions was phenomenal. Brandon was extremely responsive with an estimate, questions I had via email, answered my calls personally and quickly, and was able to schedule my project within a week. The crew arrived on time, were very friendly and helpful, and did an amazing job on my fence. I would highly recommend contacting them for any outdoor project."

      review: "I have used GreenView Solutions not once but twice in the last two years. The first time was to replace my crumbling backyard privacy fence. The second time was to help me dig out and construct a custom backyard bocce court, as well as installing some concrete walkways and a patio. In both cases, the work was completed within the agreed upon time frame and budget, and I was extremely satisfied with the end results. I should point out that in neither case was GreenView the lowest bid I received. Nevertheless, I chose them because after meeting the business owner Brandon, I felt very confident that he (and his team) will do exactly what he says they will do, and if a problem were to arise, he can be trusted to make it right."

      review: "GreenView replaced our fence in January 2022 when it blew over during a very windy few days. It was too cold to start right away so they offered to put up a temporary construction fence to help keep our dog in the yard until they could start work. Super professional, super respectful and always communicated where they were and what was remaining to be done. We had one section of the fence break about a year later (due to high winds again) and they promptly came back out to fix without any issues. 10/10 would recommend and would hire again."

      review: "Brandon and his team helped us with a backyard fountain, that no one else could fix AND built a fence for us. Brandon and his team are very professional and responsive to everything we asked. We have a new build and the fence was a little complicated working with neighbors and changes. Brandon kindly communicated with everyone involved and was very flexible as the project grew and needed some changes. His team worked long hard days. And now we have a beautiful fence! I highly recommend Brandon and his team!!"

We are talking to all of our neighbors about them because they did such a great job!

      review: "GreenView Solutions recently transformed my backyard with a cedar fence, concrete pad, landscaping, and strategic lighting installations. The quality of their work, especially the elegant cedar fence, is outstanding. But what truly sets them apart is their exceptional customer service and communication. They kept me informed throughout the project, ensuring everything went smoothly. The addition of lighting on the fence, trees, and other areas has revolutionized the look and usability of my backyard at night, creating an enchanting ambiance. Their professionalism and attention to detail are commendable. I highly recommend GreenView Solutions for their top-notch work and the remarkable transformation they offer."

      review: "This fall, I hired GreenView Solutions to replace my very old fence. I got several bids from different companies. GreenView's owner, Brandon was very thorough in his site visit and detailed in his written estimate. Due to an 8-foot variance, I pulled a permit that took a long time for the city of Denver to approve. GreenView was patient with the process and rescheduled the build for me a couple of times. Once the build started, his team was very professional, efficient and tidy. The cedar planks and steel posts were high quality and the builders' workmanship was spot-on. I'm thrilled with how the new fence looks. Everyone I worked with at GreenView was kind and professional...and I'm beyond happy with their craftsmanship."

      review: "They go by the book, which is great because you don't want someone reporting your fence to the local municipality and have to pay a fine. They give excellent customer service, great cleaning up, on top of doing an excellent job. I highly recommend them. I don't know their travelling limit but if you're in the metro area, these are your landscaping people. Others wanted to skimp by, not show up for an estimate, not give an estimate, and some wanted to charge too much. I would hire them back, no hesitation."
