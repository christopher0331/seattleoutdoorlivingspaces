# Landscaping Tips to Enhance Your Fence Line

Transform your fence from a simple boundary into a stunning landscape feature:

1. Plant climbing vines for a natural look.
2. Create a flower bed along the fence base.
3. Use potted plants for flexibility and variety.
4. Install raised beds for vegetables or herbs.
5. Add lighting to highlight your fence at night.

Remember to choose plants that complement your fence material and style. With the right approach, your fence can become a beautiful extension of your garden.
