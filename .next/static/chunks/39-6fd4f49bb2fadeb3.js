The first time was to replace my crumbling backyard privacy fence. The second time was to help me dig out and construct a custom backyard bocce court, as well as installing some concrete walkways and a patio. In both cases, the work was completed within the agreed upon time frame and budget, and I was extremely satisfied with the end results. I should point out that in neither case was GreenView the lowest bid I received. Nevertheless, I chose them because after meeting the business owner Brandon, I felt very confident that he (and his team) will do exactly what he says they will do, and if a problem were to arise, he can be trusted to make it right.",avatar:"https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=3",rating:5},{id:7,name:"Chris Hester",location:"Redmond, WA",text:"GreenView replaced our fence in January 2022 when it blew over during a very windy few days. It was too cold to start right away so they offered to put up a temporary construction fence to help keep our dog in the yard until they could start work. Super professional, super respectful and always communicated where they were and what was remaining to be done. We had one section of the fence break about a year later (due to high winds again) and they promptly came back out to fix without any issues. 10/10 would recommend and would hire again.",avatar:"https://i.pravatar.cc/150?img=4",rating:5},{id:8,name:"Beth Felgar",location:"Sammamish, WA",text:"Greenview did an excellent job with the fence.
